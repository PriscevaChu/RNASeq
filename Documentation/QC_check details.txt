QC check

Sequence Duplication Levels

"FastQC assumes that all samples are for whole genome sequencing and will flag them as failed if they differ too much from that assumption. This will, for example, cause essentially all RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and ATAC-seq samples to fail in one module or another. This is not any cause for concern and is completely expected. Primarily concern yourself with whether all of your samples are similar in their metrics."

Per Base Sequence Content

It's worth noting that some types of library will always produce biased sequence composition, normally at the start of the read. Libraries produced by priming using random hexamers (including nearly all RNA-Seq libraries) and those which were fragmented using transposases inherit an intrinsic bias in the positions at which reads start. This bias does not concern an absolute sequence, but instead provides enrichement of a number of different K-mers at the 5' end of the reads. Whilst this is a true technical bias, it isn't something which can be corrected by trimming and in most cases doesn't seem to adversely affect the downstream analysis. It will however produce a warning or error in this module.
